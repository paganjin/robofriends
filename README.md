This is my first responsive design & first deployed project.\
● Designed and developed the project from a simple prototype to a single-page web application\
● Using HTML5, Sass and JavaScript ES6 to build this web app\
● Designed the layout and drafted graphics for the website and the app on Adobe Photoshop\
● Using the flex-box to build a responsive web app that can respond to the user's behaviour and environment based on screen size, platform and orientation
